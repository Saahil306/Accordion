# Accordion

A simple accordion built using HTML and JavaScript.

Building From Scratch
Creating a JavaScript accordion is all about breaking the larger task into manageable steps. Download the index.html and accordion.js files, then work through each step belowâ€”make sure each one is complete and tested before moving on.

1. Use CSS to initially hide all content sections.

2. Add a click event to each section header. For now, just console.log("open") when clicked.

3. Update the function to detect which section was clicked. Use console.log() to verify.

4. When clicked, reveal the content directly beneath the selected header.

5. Add an if statement to toggle visibility.

6. Ensure all other sections are hidden before showing the new one
